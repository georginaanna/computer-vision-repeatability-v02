# Data-centric AI using experimental training data
## Computer vision data for object detection of potato stems.  The files ehre are a sensitivity analysis of errors in training dataset labelling (potato stem box center distance + stem count) and the effect this hass on aspects of training an object detection model 

This repo is an analysis:

-a set of potato plant images with bounding box coordinates in cxywh format for each plant stem. The photos and data were generated by Ed Harris, George Wager, Matt Butler, and Joe Mhango at Harper Adams University 2019-2021.

-a repeatability experiment of subjects placing bounding boxes on live and computer images
-a yolov5 experiment looking at the affect of bounding box accuracy on detection performance
-a yolov5 experiment looking at the affect of bounding box number on detection performance
